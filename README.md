# Quickgrid
Implement pathfinding algorithms on grids using C++!

The goal of this project was to build a boilerplate where a pathfinding algorithm can be implemented quickly without worrying about writing code to read input grids, print outputs, or create extra classes for organizing the implementation.

Input grids here are .txt files, saved in impl/grid/

The .cpp files having the pathfinding algorithms are in impl folder. The utility code is stored in includes folder.
